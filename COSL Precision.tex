\section{Opening Bids}

All strong hands (\vone{with one exception}\footnote{Balanced 22-23
  point hands are opened \nt{2}.}) are opened \cl{1} which is forcing
for one round. In general, a major suit opening shows $5^+$-cards and
the higher ranking suit is opened with suits of equal length. A
no-trump opening shows a balanced hand with a possible 5-card minor. A
\di{1} opening normally shows a 3-card holding but could sometimes be
made with a doubleton when bidding \nt{1} or \cl{2} is unattractive
e.g., \hhand{AQJT,KQ,76,J7642} or \hhand{AKT9,AK98,432,32}.

\subsection{Bidding after a positive suit response \cl{1}--\he{1}/\sp{1}/\cl{2}/\di{2}}

\vtwo{
  \hypertarget{1csuit}
  Opener rebids no-trumps with a balanced hand. With support for
  responder's suit he has the option of initiating a series of
  \emph{asking bids}.\footnote{As a rule of thumb, asking bids should
    not be used if two of the outside suits are missing first-round
    controls. This is because once asking bids are triggered, there is
    no way to return to natural bidding.} With an unbalanced hand and no
  support for responder's suit, opener bids his suit and further bidding
  is natural. All bids short of game are forcing.

  With a 4-4-4-1 distribution, if responder bids the singleton suit, opener
  should rebid no-trumps. E.g., \nt{1} over \he{1} or \nt{2} over
  \di{2}. If responder rebids his suit, opener should rebid \nt{}.
  Partner should cater to this possibility and insist on his suit as
  trumps only with a $6^+$-card suit.

  In general, over a minor suit positive response, an \nt{} bid
  by opener is preferred if it is likely that the final contract will
  be \nt{3}. This will ensure that the strong hand is
  declarer. Similarly, with a 5-card minor suit, opener should
  consider rebidding \nt{} rather than his suit since, in most cases,
  \nt{3} is preferable to 5 in a minor.

\subsection{Bidding after an \emph{Unusual Positive} response}

\vtwo{

  An unusual positive response shows a 4-4-4-1 distribution. With less

  directly---\cl{3} is bid with a black singleton and \di{3} is bid
  with a red singleton. With more than 4 controls (typically
  $12^+$\hcp), the singleton is immediately known since responder bids
  the the suit below the singleton.

  After \cl{3} or \di{3}, opener bids the next higher suit to ask
  responder to clarify where his singleton lies.  Responder bids one
  step above the relay to show the lower ranking suit and two steps
  above to show the higher ranking suit.
}

\begin{longtable}{ p{5cm}p{6cm}  }
  \multicolumn{2}{l}{\emph{Possible sequences after an unusual positive}}\\

\subsection{Handling intervention over \cl{1}}

Over a double of \cl{1}, the additional bids of \emph{Redouble} and
\emph{Pass} are used to provide more information. When the double is
conventional (e.g., shows both majors), the bidding is the same except
that a bid of \nt{1} would also confirm stoppers in both majors. All
other bids retain their normal meaning.

\begin{longtable}{ p{1.5cm}p{9.5cm} }
  \hline
  \multicolumn{2}{l}{\emph{\underline{After \cl{1}--(Double)}}} \\
  \emph{Pass} & 0-4\hcp. \\
  \di{1} & 5-7\hcp, artificial. \forcing{} \\
  \emph{Redouble} & \vtwo{$8^+$\hcp, usually balanced.} \forcing{ to
                    game}. \\
  \vtwo{\nt{1}} & \vtwo{Normal 8-13\hcp, but if the double shows a two-suited hand,
                  shows stoppers in both implied suits.} \\
  \emph{Others} & Same as over \cl{1} without intervention. \\
  \hline
\end{longtable}

After an overcall in a suit at the one-level, any suit or no-trump bid
is a positive response forcing to game. A \emph{trap pass} can be made
when responder wants to double for penalties---in this case, he will
pass a re-opening double by opener.

When opponents overcall with \nt{1}, the responses are different
depending on whether the overcall is a genuine strong hand or
conventional showing a two-suiter (the \emph{unusual no-trump}). In
the latter case, the \emph{unusual over unusual} approach repurposes
the \cl{2} and \di{2} bids to show a game-going hand with a major
suit.

\begin{longtable}{ p{1.5cm}p{9.5cm} }
  \hline
  \multicolumn{2}{l}{\emph{\underline{After a one-level suit overcall \cl{1}--(\di{1}/\he{1}/\sp{1})}}} \\
  \emph{Pass} & 0-4\hcp\ \vtwo{or a \emph{trap pass}}. \\
  \emph{Double} & 5-8\hcp\ unbalanced \vtwo{or $5^+$\hcp, balanced}. \\
  \emph{Suit} & Natural, $5^+$-card suit. \forcing{ to game} \\
  \emph{Jump to \cl{3}/\di{3}} & Unusual positive with 4-4-4-1. \\
  \emph{Cue Bid} & \vtwo{Balanced hand with \emph{no stopper} in opponent's
                   suit}, \forcing{ to game} \\
  \nt{} & Usual meaning \vtwo{and promises a stopper in opponent's suit}. \\
  \multicolumn{2}{l}{\emph{\underline{After a no-trump overcall \cl{1}--(\nt{1}) showing minors}}} \\
  \emph{Double} & Modest high-card points, suitable for penalising one
                  of opponent's suits, usually no 5-card major. \\
  \cl{2} & $5^+$-card heart suit, \forcing{ to game.} \\
  \di{2} &  $5^+$-card spade suit, \forcing{ to game.} \\
              & \vtwo{The above two bids are the so-called
                \emph{unusual over unusual} responses in which cue
                bids of known suits correspond to forcing bids in the
                unbid suits.} \\
  \he{2}/\sp{} & Natural, non-forcing. \\

A \di{2} opening describes a three suited hand with shortness in
diamonds and the responder can place the contract fairly easily in
most cases. The only positive response is \nt{2} which is forcing to
game.

\subsection{Intervention over \di{2}}

\vtwo{
  When opponents overcall, all doubles are for penalties. If the
  overcall is at the two-level, a response of \nt{2} has the same
  meaning as if there was no overcall. If the overcall is at the
  three-level, bidding is as per competitive judgment and
  vulnerability.

  When opponents double \di{2} (possibly showing values in diamonds),
  a \emph{Redouble} shows a desire to play in diamonds. You have a
  surprise holding in diamonds and are prepared to punish the
  opponents when they run from the redouble. A \emph{Pass} is a
  waiting action for partner to clarify his shape.  Partner will do
  this by either \emph{Redoubling} with a 4-4-1-4 or 4-4-0-5 minimum,
  bidding \he{2} with a 3-4-1-5 distribution or \sp{2} with 4-3-1-5.
  All bids other than \emph{Pass} and \emph{Redouble} retain the same
  meaning as without the double.

  \hypertarget{namyats}
  The \emph{Namyats} convention (\emph{Stayman} spelt backwards) shows
  a long (normally eight cards) major with eight or more playing
  tricks but not much playing strength outside the trump suit (\cl{4}
  shows hearts and \di{4} shows spades). The bid is meant to be
  constructive than pre-emptive and allows you to distinguish hands
  that are close to game versus purely pre-emptive openings. Responses

                   him to bid his suit (\he{} or \sp{}). After opener

\section{Competitive Bidding}

\subsection{Overcalls}

At the one level, overcall with a 5-card suit and 8-15\hcp. At the
two-level, overcall with at least 11-15\hcp. Responses to a suit
overcall are:

\begin{longtable}{p{1.5cm}p{9.5cm}}
  \hline
  \emph{Pass} & $<$8\hcp. \\
  \emph{Raise} & 9-10\hcp\ with 3-card support. \\
  \nt{1} & 9-10\hcp, balanced with a stopper in opponent's suit. \\
  \hline
\end{longtable}

A \nt{1} overcall should be 13-15\hcp\ with a stopper in the opponent's
suit.

A jump suit overcall is a weak preemptive bid with a $6^+$-card suit.

A cue bid is \emph{Michael's} showing a 2-suiter in the highest unbid
suit and another.

\subsection{Doubles}

A direct double over opponent's opening is either 13-15\hcp\ (takeout)
or a power double with $16^+$\hcp.

A \emph{takeout} double over opponent's minor opening bid usually
promises a 4-card suit in both majors. Over a major suit opening, it
promise a 4-card suit in the other major. A response is requested even
with a blank hand unless the other opponent bids.

\begin{longtable}{p{1.5cm}p{9.5cm}}
  \hline
  \emph{Pass} & Long and solid holding in opponent's suit \\
  \emph{1-level} & 5-8\hcp. \\
  \emph{2-level} & 7-11\hcp. \\
  \emph{3-level} & 9-13\hcp. \\
  \nt{1} & 8-10\hcp\ with stopper in opponent's suit. \\
  \emph{Jump} & $9^+$\hcp. \\
  \hline
\end{longtable}

If the doubler rebids or raises, it indicates a power hand of $16^+$\hcp.

\gap

Doubles of an opponent's overcall are \emph{negative} doubles
indicating a lack of a biddable 5-card suit and no fit with partner's
bid suit. Interest in one of the unbid suits is strongly indicated.

At the one-level, the \emph{negative} double shows 8-15\hcp; at the
two-level, it shows 11-15\hcp. Over an opponent's overcall in a major,
it promises a 4-card holding in the other major.

\gap

A double in a competitive auction is a \emph{responsive} double
indicating 3-card support in partner's suit.

\gap

A double of a slam contract is a \emph{Lightner} double requesting an
unusual lead from partner.

\section{Gadgets and Conventions}

\subsection{Stayman Convention}
\label{stayman}
\hypertarget{stayman}
The \emph{Stayman} convention is used to find a 4-4 major suit fit
after a \nt{1} opening by bidding \cl{2}. Opener responds with one of:

\begin{longtable}{p{1.5cm}p{9.5cm}}
  \hline
  \di{2} & No four card major. \\
  \he{2} & 4-card heart suit, may have 4-card spades. \\
  \sp{2} & 4-card spade suit, no 4-card heart suit. \\
  \hline
\end{longtable}

\subsubsection{Puppet Stayman}

\vtwo{
  \hypertarget{puppetstayman}
  Used over a \nt{2} bid that may be made with a 5-card major, \cl{3}
  is a conventional bid that endeavours to find a major suit
  fit. Responses are:
}

\begin{longtable}{p{1.5cm}p{9.5cm}}
  \hline
  \di{3} & No five card major but at least one four card major.
           Responder with one four card major should bid
           the major that he \emph{does not have} and if there is
           a 4-4 fit, opener will bid it. \\
  \he{3} & 5-card heart suit. \\
  \sp{3} & 5-card spade suit. \\
  \nt{3} & No 4 or 5-card major. Responder can bid \cl{4} or \di{4}
           to transfer to \he{4} or \sp{4} respectively when he has
           a six-card major. \\
  \hline
\end{longtable}

\subsection{Roman Key-Card Blackwood}
\label{blackwood}
\hypertarget{blackwood}
A \emph{Roman Key-Card Blackwood} bid of \nt{4} is used to enquire
about the number of key cards (any ace or the trump suit king) in
partner's hand.

\emph{RKCB} should not be used when you have a void or two fast
losers.

The responses to the bid of \nt{4} are in steps and differ depending
on whether opponents have bid over \nt{4}. Note that the 3rd and 4th
steps show only 2 key cards if opponents have intervened since the 5
key card response is shown by step 2 in such cases.

\begin{longtable}{p{3.2cm}|p{1cm}p{3cm}p{3.2cm}}
  \emph{Holding} & \emph{Silent} & \emph{Double (R0P1)} & \emph{Overcall (D0P1)} \\
  \hline
  \emph{1/4 key cards} & \cl{5} & \emph{Redouble} & \emph{Double} \\
  \emph{0/3 key cards} & \di{5} & \emph{Pass} (0/3/5 key cards) & \emph{Pass} (0/3/5 key cards) \\
  \emph{2/5 key cards
  without queen of trumps} & \he{5} & \cl{5} (two key cards) & \emph{Cheapest suit} (two key cards)
  \\
  \emph{2/5 key cards
  and queen of trumps} & \sp{5} & \di{5} (two key cards) & \emph{Second-cheapest suit} (two key cards)\\
  
  \hline
\end{longtable}

When holding a void, after a trump suit is agreed, jumping to another
suit at the 4 or 5 level in the void suit initiates a \emph{key card
  exclusion} asking bid. Partner shows his key cards \emph{excluding}
any in the void suit in steps.

\begin{longtable}{p{1.5cm}p{9.5cm}}
  \hline
  \emph{1 step} & 1 or 4 key cards. \\
  \emph{2 steps} & 0 or 3 key cards. \\
  \emph{3 steps} & 2 or 5 key cards without trump Q. \\
  \emph{4 steps} & 2 or 5 key cards with trump Q. \\
  \hline
\end{longtable}

\subsection{Gerber Ace-asking Convention}
\label{gerber}
\hypertarget{gerber}
An immediate response of \cl{4} to any no-trump bid (or overcall) is
the \emph{Gerber} ace-asking convention. A jump rebid of \cl{4} in
response to a natural no-trump bid is \emph{Gerber} as also when a
trump suit has not been identified and no-trumps has been
rebid. Gerber should not be used holding a void.

Opener shows number of aces in steps as follows:

\begin{longtable}{p{1.5cm}p{9.5cm}}
  \hline
  \di{4} & Zero or four aces. \\
  \he{4} & One ace. \\
  \sp{4} & Two aces. \\
  \nt{4} & Three aces. \\
  \hline
\end{longtable}

\subsection{$\beta$ Control Asking Bid}

\hypertarget{controlask}
A $\beta$ control asking bid can occur either after a \nt{1} rebid by
the \cl{1} opener over a positive suit response or by cue bidding a
singleton suit after a positive response of \cl{3}, \di{3}, \he{3},
\sp{3}, \cl{4} or \di{4} over \cl{1}.

The number of controls held (\emph{A=2}, \emph{K=1}) are shown in
steps as below:

\begin{longtable}{ p{1.5cm}p{9.5cm} }
  \hline
  \emph{1 step} & 0-2 controls.
                  A relay bid by opener in the cheapest suit over the
                  1-step response will then ask for clarification and

\subsection{$\epsilon$ Control Asking Bid}

\vtwo{
  \hypertarget{epsilon}
  The $\epsilon$-asking bid is used to find out what controls the
  responder holds in a specific suit. It follows a $\gamma$ asking bid
  and terminates only when trumps or no-trumps is bid, i.e., any other
  suit bid is an $\epsilon$-ask in that suit.  Responses are in
  steps:
}

\begin{longtable}{p{1.5cm}p{9.5cm}}
  \multicolumn{2}{l}{\vtwo{\emph{Responses to a $epsilon$-suit asking bid}}} \\
  \hline
  \vtwo{\emph{1 step}} & \vtwo{No control---\emph{Jxx} or worse.} \\
  \vtwo{\emph{2 steps}} & \vtwo{Third round control---\emph{Q} or doubleton.} \\
  \vtwo{\emph{3 steps}} & \vtwo{Second round control---\emph{K} or singleton.} \\
  \vtwo{\emph{4 steps}} & \vtwo{First round control---\emph{A} or void.} \\
  \vtwo{\emph{5 steps}} & \vtwo{\emph{AK} or \emph{AQ}.} \\
  \hline
\end{longtable}

\vtwo{
  The $\epsilon$-ask can be repeated if it is important to know
  whether the control is based on shortness or strength. The response
  is again in steps---the first step showing that the previous
  response was based on \emph{shortness} and the second step showing
  \emph{strength}.

  If the first $\epsilon$ bid is at the level of \cl{5} or higher, a
  compressed scale of responses is used where the first step shows no
  control, second step shows second-round control and the third step
  shows first-round control.

\subsection{Jacoby Transfers}
\label{jacoby}
\hypertarget{jacoby}
After a \nt{1} opening, responder bids \di{2} with a 5-card or better
heart suit and \he{2} with spades. Opener will bid \he{2} or \sp{2} so
that the strong hand becomes declarer. Responder's rebids are:

\begin{longtable}{p{2.5cm}p{8.5cm}}
  \hline
  \emph{Pass} & A weak hand with $5^+$-card \he{} or \sp{}. \\
  \sp{2} & Invitational with 5-5 in the majors after
           \nt{1}--\di{2}--\he{2}. \\
  \nt{2} & Balanced or semi-balanced hand with 5-card \he{} or
           \sp{}. Invitational---partner can pass or sign-off in
           3 of a major or bid \nt{3}. \\
  \cl{3}/\di{} & 4-card suit in addition to 5-card major,
                 \forcing{ to game} \\
  \emph{Raise} & 6-card suit, invitational. \\
  \he{3} & (After \sp{2}) 5-5 in the majors with slam
           interest. Stronger than an immediate jump to \he{4}. \\
  \sp{3} & (After \he{2}) Singleton or void with slam interest. \\
  \nt{3} & Balanced or semi-balanced hand. Partner can pass or correct
           to 4 of major. \\
  \he{4} & (After \sp{2}) 5-5 in majors with no slam interest. Partner
           can pass or correct to \sp{4}. \\
  \emph{Double raise} & $6^+$-card major, sign-off. \\
  \nt{4} & Quantitative, inviting slam in major or no-trumps. \\
  \hline
\end{longtable}

\vtwo{
\hypertarget{superaccept}
Opener could \emph{super-accept} the transfer with a $4^+$-card
holding in the transfer suit. In this case, he can break the transfer
and show any doubletons.  For example, after \nt{1}--\he{2} (transfer
to \sp{2}), opener with a 4-card spade suit could bid:
}

\begin{longtable}{p{2.5cm}p{8.5cm}}

\subsection{Jacoby 2NT}
\label{jacoby2nt}
\hypertarget{jacoby2nt}
A \nt{2} response over an opening of \he{1} or \sp{1} is conventional
and shows $13^+$\hcp\ with $4^+$-card support of partner's suit. It is
\forcing{ to game.} Opener's rebids are:

\begin{longtable}{p{3.5cm}p{7.5cm}}
  \hline
  \emph{New suit} & Singleton or void in suit bid. \\
  \emph{Rebid of suit at 3-level} & Maximum strength hand. \\

  \emph{Game in original suit} & Minimum opening, sign-off. \\
  \nt{3} & 12-13 \hcp, medium strength hand. \\
  \hline
\end{longtable}


\subsection{Bergen Raises}

\hypertarget{bergen}
After a \he{1} or \sp{1} opening, responses of \cl{3}, \di{3}, \he{3}
and \sp{3} show different types of 4-card support. The mnemonic
\emph{CLAP} (Constructive, Limited and Preemptive) helps to remember
the order of the bids.

\begin{longtable}{p{1.5cm}p{9.5cm}}
  \hline
  \emph{\he{1}--\cl{3}} & Constructive, 7-10\hcp, 4-card \he{}. \\

  \emph{\he{1}--\he{3}} & Preemptive, 0-6\hcp, 4-card \he{}. \\
  \emph{\sp{1}--\cl{3}} & Constructive, 7-10\hcp, 4-card \sp{}. \\
  \emph{\sp{1}--\di{3}} & Limited, 10-12\hcp, 4-card \sp{}. \\
  \emph{\sp{1}--\he{3}} & \emph{Spare bid}---used to show a strong
                          $12^+$\hcp\ hand with 4-card support and an

  \emph{\sp{1}--\sp{3}} & Preemptive, 0-6\hcp, 4-card \sp{}. \\
  \hline
\end{longtable}

\subsection{Lebensohl}
\label{lebensohl}
\hypertarget{lebensohl}
The \emph{Lebensohl} convention is used by responder after an opponent
overcalls partner's opening \nt{1} bid in order to compete further
without necessarily committing to game. It is initiated after the
right-hand opponent makes a suit overcall at the two-level.

\begin{longtable}{p{2.5cm}p{8.5cm}}
  \hline
  \emph{2 in new suit} & Natural and non-forcing. \\

                           overcaller's is natural and invitational. \\

           suit. \\
  \hline
\end{longtable}

\section{Miscellaneous}

\emph{High-card Points} (\hcp) are assigned as follows---Ace=4,
King=3, Queen=2 and Jack=1.  Once a trump-fit has been found,
distribution points can be assigned---Void=3, Singleton=2,
Doubleton=1.

Singleton honours should be counted only once (either \hcp\ or
shortness).

\gap

\emph{Suit Quality} (\sq) is calculated as suit length plus number of
honours in the suit. The Jack or Ten should be counted only if a
higher ranking honour is held. For example, a holding of K-J-9-5-4
would have 7\sq\ but J-10-9-5-4 would have 5\sq.

For an overcall, the \sq\ should equal or exceed the number of tricks
bid (e.g., \sq\ of 8 for a 2-level overcall).

When preempting, the \sq\ should equal the level of preempt when
vulnerable and can be one less when non-vulnerable.

\gap

The \emph{Losing Trick Count} (\ltc) is used only once a trump suit
has been established. Count losers only in the top three cards of the
suit holding---there are never more than 3 losers in a suit. With
three or more cards, A/K/Q are not losers but any lower card is a
loser. With two cards, only A or K are not losers.

Add your and partner's loser count and subtract from 24 to estimate
the number of tricks that can be won.  You can estimate your partner's
\ltc\ as follows:

\begin{tabular}{rp{3cm}}
  \emph{\hcp{}} & \emph{Expected Losers} \\
  \hline
  \emph{7-9} & 8-9 losers (9) \\
  \emph{10-12} & 7-8 losers (8) \\
  \emph{13-15} & 6-7 losers (7) \\
  \emph{16-18} & 5-6 losers (6) \\
  \emph{19-21} & 4-5 losers (5) \\
  \emph{$22^+$} & 4 losers or less \\
  \hline

\subsection{Negative Response over \cl{1}}

\hypertarget{ex1c1d}
After a \di{1} response, there is no temptation to get too high on
misfitting hands. For example,

\vhand[West]{4,AK954,AJ4,KQT9}\vhand[East]{KJT753,62,753,54}
\ewauction{1c,1d,1h,1s(1),2c(2),2s(3)}\\ (1) 4-7\hcp, 4+-card
suit. \\ (2) Shows minimum with second 4-card suit (implies 5
hearts). \\ (3) 6-card suit, no fit.

Opener shows discipline and passes recognising misfit and no chance
for game.

\gap
A \di{1} response does not rule out game. With a 2-suited hand,
it is easy to find a game contract when the fit is in the second bid
suit.

\vhand[West]{AK752,AQT43,A5,2}\vhand[East]{4,K852,9642,J754}
\ewauction{1c,1d,1s,1n(1),2h,3h,4h} \\ (1) As he has already
limited his hand, East is not afraid to improve the contract. After
that, all goes smoothly.

Suppose the lead against \he{4} is a low diamond. The best technique
for declarer is to win with the Ace, cash \sp{}A and ruff a spade with
a low trump. Then he plays a club to establish communication between
the two hands.

The opponents will probably continue diamonds. West ruffs the third
round and leads another low spade, ruffing with the \he{}8. If, at
worst, spades are 5-2 and South overruffs, declarer retains the
possibility of ruffing the other spade loser with the \he{}K. The
contract will fail only against very unlucky distribution.

\gap
With a powerful hand, opener would jump rebid his suit and responder
would know there is a game or slam on if he is in the upper range. For
example,

\vhand[West]{AKJ8753,A,K72,AQ}\vhand[East]{642,J73,AJ54,865}
\ewauction{1c,1d,2s(1),3d(2),3s(3),4s,4n,5c(4),6s} \\
(1) 22+\hcp, 5-card suit. \\ (2) 4-7\hcp, showing side-suit before
showing fit in spades. \\ (3) After the new suit bid at the 3-level,
opener knows he will not be left in \sp{3}. \\ (4) One key card.

After a heart lead and assuming trumps don't break worse than 2-1, the
contract can be made without the club finesse by playing \emph{A} and
\emph{K} of diamonds followed by a low diamond towards the
\emph{J}. This works whenever diamonds break 3-3, \di{}\emph{Q} is
held by North or is a doubleton with South.

\gap
With a balanced hand, opener will rebid \nt{}. For example,

\vhand[West]{K63,KJT,A862,AK3}\vhand[East]{AJ742,754,J95,T4}
\ewauction{1c,1d,1n(1),2h(2),2s,2n(3),3n(4)} \\
(1) 17-19\hcp, balanced. \\ (2) Weak transfer to \sp{2}. \\ (3)
Balanced hand, invitational. \\ (4) With 18\hcp\ and three cards in
spades, East tries for game in no trumps.

North leads the \he{}3, South plays the Queen and West the King. After
this favourable opening, West can afford to make a safety play in
spades. He plays King and another, North following suit with low
cards. To make absolutely sure of four tricks, even when North holds
Q10xx, declarer ducks in dummy. He makes game with four spades, two
hearts and three top tricks in the minors.

\gap
Even with a weak two-suiter, Precision enables finding slams with
relatively low point counts following a negative response. For
example,

\vhand[West]{A854,AK943,AKJ8,}\vhand[East]{6,J87652,Q976,64}
\ewauction{1c,1d,1h,3s(1),4c,4h(2),6h} \\ (1) Splinter
showing 4-card or better support in hearts and a singleton or void
in spades. \\ (2) Responder could conceivably also bid \he{5}
with the 6-card suit.

With a combined total of 22 points, although 13 tricks are available
if the opening lead is not ruffed, most pairs will probably stop in
\he{6} after the splinter bid using a sequence similar to the one
above.

\subsection{Positive Response in a Suit after \cl{1}}

\hypertarget{ex1csuit}
Using Precision, game is always reached after a positive response to a
\cl{1} opening.  The partnership will have a minimum of 24 points if
opener is unbalanced (16 vs 8) or 25 points if he is balanced (17 vs
8). This works well in practice, for example:

\vhand[West]{AKJ86,64,KQT9,K6}\vhand[East]{Q92,875,A543,Q94}
\ewauction{1c,1n,2s,3s,4s} \\
A dull 16\hcp\ \cl{1} opening against an equally dull 8\hcp\ but still
\sp{4} is an odds-on favourite to make.

\gap
Game contracts can be reached on smaller point counts if there are
distributional features. For example,

\vhand[West]{AKJT96,A,QJT9,65}\vhand[East]{Q82,965,K743,743}
\ewauction{1c(1),1d,1s,3s(2),4s} \\ (1) A strong 15\hcp\ with a
good suit should be opened with \cl{1}.\\ (2) As he has already
limited his hand, East is not shy in raising partner's suit with 5\hcp
and inviting game.

As compared to the previous deal, this is a 15\hcp\ vs 5\hcp\ hand
that may be passed out after \sp{1} in standard systems. However, the
game contract is virtually lay-down.

\gap
With a balanced hand, opener will rebid \nt{} over a positive suit
response.  Even with 3-card support for partner's suit, it is
sometimes correct to first bid \nt{} and only later raise partner's
suit. For example, with \hhand{AJT,KQT9,QJ4,KJ7}, if responder bids
\sp{1}, it is correct to rebid \nt{1} showing a balanced minimum
before raising spades. However, with a slightly different hand such as
\hhand{AJT7,KQT,QJ4,KJ7}, the rebid could be \sp{3} or \sp{4} showing
a minimum hand, probably balanced, with 4-card support.

Alternative sequences showing support have slightly different
meanings.  For example, whereas the sequence \cl{1}--\sp{1}--\sp{4}
would show a minimum hand with poor controls, the sequence
\cl{1}--\sp{1}--\nt{1}--any--\sp{4} would show a balanced minimum with
good controls.

The intermediate \nt{1} rebid can also be made when you want to find
out if responder has a distributional hand. For example, when holding
\hhand{AK87,A753,KQ4,A6}, after partner's positive response of \sp{1},
rebid \nt{1} and if partner rebids \cl{2} (four-card suit), you may
have very good play for \sp{7} if partner is holding something like
\hhand{QJ543,82,A8,K954}.  However, you need to know about the four
clubs first.

\gap
With a distributional hand where you have strong support for partner's
suit and the only question for slam is whether his suit has good
quality, \emph{asking bids} ($\gamma$ and $\epsilon$) can be used to
good effect. For example,

\vhand[West]{QJ632,5,AKQ8,KJ9}\vhand[East]{AKT54,987,T4,A53}
\ewauction{1c,1s,2s(1),3h(2),4c(*),4n(3),5h(*),5s(4),6s} \\
(1) $\gamma$ trump asking bid (possible slam if trumps are strong). \\
(2) 2 honours, 5-card suit. \\ (*) $\epsilon$ control asking bid in clubs and hearts. \\
(3) Ace or void. \\ (4) No control.

With a sure loser in hearts, opener stops in the small slam.

\subsection{Positive No-Trump Response to \cl{1}}

\hypertarget{ex1cnt}
With both majors, it is sometimes correct to use \emph{Stayman} even
when holding a 5-card suit.  For example, holding
\hhand{AKQ64,KQ87,A5,95}, it is better to bid \cl{2} over a \nt{1}
response rather than bidding \sp{2}. If responder holds something like
\hhand{JT2,AJ94,543,Q43}, he will certainly raise spades after \sp{2}
and the 4-4 heart fit will not be discovered. In this case although
there are 10 tricks in spades and 11 in hearts (given normal breaks),
sometimes the difference may be 10 tricks in the 4-4 fit versus 9 in
the 5-3 fit.

Similarly, with \hhand{3,AKQ7,AQ,KQJT98}, bid \emph{Stayman}. If
partner bids \di{2} (four hearts), you will bid \he{2} and later ask
for aces. If partner has two aces, you can confidently bid the grand
slam or the small slam if he shows only one ace. If partner holds
something like \hhand{AQ6,JT86,J76,543}, \he{6} from the strong side
is best, while \cl{6} will depend on the diamond finesse.

\subsection{\sp{3} response to \cl{1}}

\hypertarget{ex1c3s}
Opener can place the contract fairly easily given responder's solid
suit and use asking bids to decide if a slam is on. For example,

\vhand[West]{4,AT987,A4,AKQ87}\vhand[East]{AKQJ987,3,K7,T96}
\ewauction{1c,3s(1),4c(2),4h(3),7s(4)} \\
(1) Solid suit. Opener can tell that it is spades by looking
at his own hand. \\ (2) $\beta$-ask for outside controls. \\
(3) One outside control (\di{} or \he{} king). \\ (4) 13 tricks
are on top.

\subsection{Unusual Positive Response to \cl{1}}

\hypertarget{ex1c3c}
If responder bids an \emph{unusual positive}, slam is most likely on
the cards and with the right cards, grand slams can be reached on very
low point counts.

\vhand[West]{AKQ876,976,AK43,}\vhand[East]{J543,A,T987,AK43}
\ewauction{1c,4d(1),4h(2),4n(3),7s(4)} \\ (1) 4-1-4-4,
$4^+$-controls, $12^+$\hcp \\ (2) $\beta$ asking for controls \\
(3) 5 controls (2 steps) \\ (4) Partner must have two aces and
\cl{}\emph{K}, 13 tricks are visible.

Barring horrendous breaks and a ruff on the opening lead, this
27-point grand slam is lay-down.

  4 & \hhand{Q86,A6,T8,AKQ874} & Bid \cl{1} and rebid \cl{2}. Let
                                 partner be declarer in \nt{} if that
                                 is the right spot. \\
  5 & \hhand{62,87,QT,AKQJ982} & Bid \nt{3}---``Gambling'', showing a
                                 solid suit with no ace or king

                                 enquire about majors. If partner bids
                                 a major or \cl{3}, pass (you need at
                                 least another queen to raise
                                 partner's major). If partner bids

  7 & \hhand{KT9832,5,975,KJ7} & Bid \sp{2}. If partner raises spades,
                                 raise to game. Pass if he denies spades by
                                 rebidding \cl{3} or bid \cl{3} if he
                                 rebids \nt{2}. \\
  8 & \hhand{K85,KJ95,AT63,93} & Bid \nt{2} (invitational). If partner

                                 \he{4}. If partner accepts with

  9 & \hhand{AJT763,KQ9,T7,Q2} & Bid \sp{3}. This is forcing to game
                                 and shows at least 6 spades. Pass if
                                 partner signs-off in \nt{3}. \\

                                  of Total Tricks will protect you

                                  better in one of your suits so let
                                  partner know you have four spades. \\

                                  preferable to open \di{1} with this

                                  enough to play opposite a void. It
                                  must be better to have it as

\subsection{The \di{2} Opening}

Some examples of bidding after a \di{2} opening.

\begin{longtable}{r>{\raggedright}p{2.4cm}p{7cm}}
  \multicolumn{3}{l}{\emph{\underline{Responding to \di{2}}}} \\
  1 & \hhand{QJ543,AT5,KT5,AT} & Bid \sp{4}. Why mess about? \\
  2 & \hhand{54,A9,AT87643,63} & \emph{Pass}. You would also pass if one of
                                 the low diamonds was a low heart
                                 since bidding \he{2} may land you in
                                 a 3-3 fit. \\
  3 & \hhand{2,JT73,KQ64,K852} & Bid \he{2}. If partner is 4-3-1-5, he
                                 will bid \sp{2} which can be
                                 corrected to \cl{3}. Do not ask for
                                 shape since that may push bidding to
                                 the 4-level. \\
  4 & \hhand{AJ,A93,AJT97,T87} & Bid \nt{3}. Diamonds are well under
                                 control and there are no better
                                 prospects for game.\\
  5 & \hhand{AQT65,KJ,987,AQ5} & Bid \nt{2}---there is a grand slam
                                 possible here. Whatever partner bids,
                                 you will bid diamonds next to ask
                                 about controls. \\

  6 & \hhand{QT6,JT9,KQJ4,A64} & \emph{Double}. This can get ugly
                                 since opponent is bidding at the
                                 2-level with at most seven trumps and
                                 without the balance of \hcp.\\
  7 & \hhand{9,T64,AQ86543,K8} & \emph{Pass}. You could double but
                                 that would probably drive the
                                 opponents to spades which is a better
                                 spot. \\
  8 & \hhand{84,3,AKT5,987653} & Bid \cl{4}. This is a pre-emptive bid
                                 to make \emph{LHO} decide whether to
                                 support at the 4-level. \\

                                 opponents.

                                 However, with unfavourable
                                 vulnerability, it is a choice between
                                 \nt{3} (if you feel lucky) and \cl{5}
                                 (more realistic). \\
  10 & \hhand{952,A95,AJ73,743} & \emph{Double}. \\

                                  overtricks here even if partner
                                  plays in a 4-1 diamond fit. \\
  13 & \hhand{KJ965,J864,J4,Q7} & Bid \sp{2}---if opponents compete,
                                  you can try hearts next. \\
  14 & \hhand{T642,QT63,JT,K75} & \emph{Pass}. Let partner describe
                                  his shape with a redouble or bid. \\
  15 & \hhand{A5,KQT,KT9863,Q2} & \emph{Redouble}. You have a lot of
                                  diamonds and good spot cards. Even
                                  if opponent's have a 4-4 spade fit,
                                  they may not find it and even if
                                  they do it is likely you have a
                                  penalty double against them in
