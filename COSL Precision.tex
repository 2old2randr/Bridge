\section{Opening Bids}
All strong hands are opened \cl{1} which is forcing for one round. In
general, a major suit opening shows 5+-cards and the higher ranking
suit is opened with suits of equal length. A no-trump opening shows a
balanced hand with a possible 5-card minor.

A \di{1} bid is limited and denies a 5-card major or a good quality
5-card club suit. Therefore, it is possible that opener has only a
doubleton diamond holding a hand such as \hhand{AQJT,KQ,76,J7642} or
\hhand{AKT9,AK98,432,32}. In the first case, \cl{2} is not possible
because of the weak suit and \nt{1} is unattractive in both cases (in
the latter case, the \di{1} bid allows an immediate search for a major
suit fit). A 5-card major could be suppressed in exceptional cases
such as \hhand{AKQT5,AJ,JT9432,} when \di{1} should be followed by a
jump shift in \sp{} to show the fine 6-5 hand.

\begin{longtable}{ p{2.5cm}p{8.5cm} }
  \hline
  \cl{1} & 16+\hcp\ and any distribution,
           \underline{forcing}. \hyperlink{1c}{\HandCuffRight} \\

           less than 6 clubs. \hyperlink{1d}{\HandCuffRight} \\
  \he{1}, \sp{1} & 11-15\hcp, 5-cards in suit bid. Any other opening bid
                   below \he{2} (except \cl{1}) denies a 5-card
                   major. \hyperlink{1major}{\HandCuffRight} \\
  \nt{1} & 13-15\hcp, balanced. 6-3-2-2 / 5-4-2-2 in a minor ok with

                   and 7 non-vulnerable). With 6 or less losers, open

  \hline
\end{longtable}

\section{Responses to \cl{1}}

\hypertarget{1c}
The responses to \cl{1} can be negative, constructive or positive. All
positive responses are forcing to game unless both hands are minimum
and no fit is found. 

\begin{longtable}{ p{2.5cm}p{8.5cm} }
  \hline
  \multicolumn{2}{l}{\emph{\underline{Negative Response}}} \\
  \di{1} & 0-7\hcp, \underline{forcing}. \hyperlink{1c1d}{\HandCuffRight} \\
  \multicolumn{2}{l}{\emph{\underline{Constructive Responses}}} \\
  \he{2}, \sp{2} & 4-7\hcp, 6+-card suit, little strength
                   outside. \hyperlink{1c2major}{\HandCuffRight} \\
  \multicolumn{2}{l}{\emph{\underline{Positive Responses (forcing to game})}} \\
  \he{1}, \sp{1}, \cl{2}, \di{2} & 8+\hcp, 5+-cards in suit, can stop
                                   short of game if no fit.
                                   \hyperlink{1csuit}{\HandCuffRight}\\
  \nt{1} & 8-13\hcp, no five-card suit. \hyperlink{1c1nt}{\HandCuffRight} \\
  \nt{2} & 14+\hcp, balanced hand. \hyperlink{1c2nt}{\HandCuffRight} \\
  \cl{3} & 8-10\hcp, 4-4-4-1 shape with a black singleton. \\
  \di{3} & 8-10\hcp, 4-4-4-1 shape with a red singleton. \\
  \he{3}, \sp{3}, \cl{4}, \di{4} & 11+\hcp, singleton in suit above
                                   the one bid. \\
  \hline
\end{longtable}

\subsection{Handling intervention over \cl{1}}

If an opponent doubles \cl{1}, the responses other than \di{1} remain
the same. However, the additional possible responses of \emph{Pass}
and \emph{Redouble} are used to provide more granular
information. Over an opponent's overcall in a suit at the 1-level (or
a \nt{1} overcall), different responses are used as in the table
below.

\begin{longtable}{ p{2.5cm}p{8.5cm} }
  \hline
  \multicolumn{2}{l}{\emph{\underline{After \cl{1}--Double}}} \\
  \emph{Pass} & 0-4\hcp. \\
  \di{1} & 5-7\hcp, \underline{forcing}. \\
  \emph{Redouble} & 8+\hcp, 4-4 in the major suits. \\
  \emph{Others} & Same as over \cl{1} without intervention. \\
  \multicolumn{2}{l}{\emph{\underline{After \cl{1}--\di{1}/\he{1}/\sp{1}}}} \\
  \emph{Pass} & 0-4\hcp. \\
  \emph{New suit} & 5-8\hcp, 5+-card suit. \\
  \emph{Jump in suit} & 8-10\hcp, 6+-card suit. \\
  \nt{1} & 9-11\hcp\ with stopper in opponent's suit. \\
  \nt{2} & 12-14\hcp\ with one or two stoppers. \\
  \emph{Double} & 5-8\hcp\ or 9+\hcp, no 5-card suit,
                  \underline{takeout}. Cue bid on next round clarifies hand as
                  9+\hcp. \\
  \emph{Cue Bid} & 9+\hcp, \underline{game forcing}. \\
  \multicolumn{2}{l}{\emph{\underline{After \cl{1}--\nt{1}}}} \\
  \emph{Pass} & 0-4\hcp. \\
  \emph{New suit} & 5-8\hcp, 5+-card suit. \\
  \emph{Double} & 5+\hcp. \\
  \hline
\end{longtable}

\subsection{Bidding after a negative response \cl{1}-\di{1}}

\hypertarget{1c1d}
Opener rebids \nt{1}, \nt{2} or \he{3} with balanced hands (16-18,
19-21 or 25+\hcp\ respectively), minimum suit bids with 16-21\hcp\ and
a jump in a suit with 22+\hcp. Further bidding is largely natural.

\begin{longtable}{ p{2.5cm}p{8.5cm} }
  \hline

\subsection{Bidding after a constructive response \cl{1}-\he{2}/\sp{2}}

\hypertarget{1c2major}
Opener needs to decide the best contract and if there is no chance for
game or slam, he should pass with a tolerance for responder's suit.

\begin{longtable}{ p{2.5cm}p{8.5cm} }
  \hline
  \emph{Pass} & Game unlikely \\
  \nt{3}, \he{4}, \sp{4} & Raise to game is a sign-off \\

              & \begin{tabular}{p{1.8cm}p{5cm}}
                  \emph{Raise} & 3+-card support or Qx. \\

\subsection{Bidding after a positive no-trump response \cl{1}--1NT/2NT}

\hypertarget{1c1nt}
\cl{2} after a response of \nt{1} is \emph{Transfer Stayman} and responder rebids as below:

\begin{longtable}{ p{2.5cm}p{8.5cm} }
  \hline
  \di{2} & 8-10\hcp, 4 card \he{}, may have 4 card

  \hline
\end{longtable}

\gap

A \di{2}, \he{2}, \sp{2} or \cl{3} rebid by opener over the \nt{1}
response shows a good suit and asks responder to show strength and fit
in the bid suit. The responses are in steps as below:

\begin{longtable}{ p{2.5cm}p{8.5cm}  }

  \emph{4 steps} & 11-13\hcp\ with 3+-card support. \\
  \hline
\end{longtable}

Any new suit bid by the \cl{1} opener that is not a relay and is under
the level of game is a \emph{control asking bid} and responses
are in steps as below:

\begin{longtable}{ p{2.5cm}p{8.5cm}  }
  \multicolumn{2}{l}{\emph{Responses to control asking bid}} \\
  \hline
  \emph{1 step} & None of the top three honours. \\

  \emph{3 steps} & Two of the top three honours. \\
  \emph{4 steps} & AKQ of suit. \\
  \hline
\end{longtable}

A raise in no-trumps by opener shows some slam interest but a direct raise to game is a sign-off.

\hypertarget{1c2nt}
Over a \nt{2} response to \cl{1}, the bidding is simpler due to the
lack of bidding room at this level.

\subsection{Bidding after a positive suit response \cl{1}--\he{1}/\sp{1}/\cl{2}/\di{2}}

\hypertarget{1csuit}
Opener may use the $\beta$ \emph{control asking bid} with a fit in
responder's suit or bid a new suit or no-trumps with no fit. With no
chance of slam, the principle of fast arrival should be used to bid
the appropriate game contract.

\section{Responses to \di{2}}

\hypertarget{2d}
A \di{2} opening describes a three suited hand with shortness
in diamonds and the responder can place the contract fairly easily in
most cases. The only positive response is \nt{2} which is forcing
to game.

\begin{longtable}{ p{2.5cm}p{8.5cm} }
  \hline
  \emph{Pass} & 6+ diamonds, no interest in other suits or bidding higher. \\
  \he{2}, \sp{2}, \cl{3} & Natural, sign-off. \\
  \nt{2} & 11+\hcp, artificial \underline{game-force} asks opener to
           further describe his hand. Opener's rebids are: \\
              & \begin{tabular}{ll}
                  \cl{3}, \di{3}  & 3=1=4=5 or 4=3=1=5 shape respectively. \\
                  \he{3} & 11-13\hcp\ and 4=4=1=4 shape. \\
                  \sp{3} & 14-15\hcp\ and 4=4=1=4 shape. \\
                  \nt{3} & 14-15\hcp, 4=4=1=4 shape and \di{} A or K. \\
                  \cl{4} & 11-13\hcp, 4=4=0=5 shape. \\

  \he{3}, \sp{3} & 7-9\hcp, preemptive, 5+-card suit. \\
  \hline
\end{longtable}

\subsection{Intervention over \di{2}}

If opponents double \di{2}, responder can either \emph{Pass} if he
wants to play in diamonds or \emph{Redouble} asking partner to bid a
major.

\section{Responses to \he{2} or \sp{2}}

\hypertarget{2major}
Opener shows a 6+-card major with 8-10\hcp\ and a good suit with a
minimum suit quality of 8 when vulnerable or 7 when non-vulnerable.

\begin{longtable}{ p{2.5cm}p{8.5cm} }
  \hline
  \emph{Pass} & No game, no fit. \\
  \emph{Raise to 3 or 4} & Natural, sign-off. \\
  \emph{New suit} & Natural, \underline{forcing}. Opener's rebids are: \\
              & \begin{tabular}{ll}
                  \emph{Raise} & 3-card support. \\
                  \emph{Rebid own suit} & Forcing. \\
                \end{tabular} \\
  \nt{2} & \underline{Forcing}. Opener bids suit with singleton or void or rebids
           his own suit. \\
  \hline
\end{longtable}

\section{Responses to 2NT}

\hypertarget{2nt}
Opener is showing 5-5 in the minors with 6-12 points and responder's
bids are:

\begin{longtable}{ p{2.5cm}p{8.5cm} }
  \hline
  \emph{Pass} & No game, no fit. \\
  \cl{3}, \di{3} & Interception bid. Opener should bid \he{3}/\sp{3}
                   with a strong hand with less than five losers. \\
  \hline
\end{longtable}

\section{Responses to \cl{3}/\di{3}/\he{3}/\sp{3}}

\hypertarget{3preempt}
After a preemptive 3-bid by opener, responder's rebids are:

\begin{longtable}{p{2.5cm}p{8.5cm}}
  \hline
  \emph{Raise} & Preemptive. \\
  \emph{New suit} & Forcing for one round. \\
  \emph{Others} & Natural. \\
  \hline
\end{longtable}

\section{Responses to 3NT}

\hypertarget{3nt}
Responses to the gambling \nt{3} are:

\begin{longtable}{p{2.5cm}p{8.5cm}}
  \hline
  \cl{4} & Asks opener to pass or bid \di{4} if that is his suit. \\
  \di{4} & Asks opener to bid his short suit(s). \\
  \nt{4} & Asking opener if he has an 8+-card suit. \\
  \hline
\end{longtable}

\section{Competitive Bidding}

\subsection{Overcalls}

At the one level, overcall with a 5-card suit and 8-15\hcp. At the
two-level, overcall with at least 11-15\hcp. Responses to a suit
overcall are:

\begin{longtable}{p{2.5cm}p{8.5cm}}
  \hline
  \emph{Pass} & $<8$\hcp. \\
  \emph{Raise} & 9-10\hcp\ with 3-card support. \\
  \nt{1} & 9-10\hcp, balanced with a stopper in opponent's suit. \\
  \hline
\end{longtable}

A \nt{1} overcall should be 13-15\hcp with a stopper in the opponent's
suit.

A jump suit overcall is a weak preemptive bid with a 6+-card suit.

A cue bid is \emph{Michael's} showing a 2-suiter in the highest unbid
suit and another.

\subsection{Doubles}

A direct double over opponent's opening is either 13-15\hcp\ (takeout)
or a power double with 16+\hcp.

A \emph{takeout} double over opponent's minor opening bid usually
promises a 4-card suit in both majors. Over a major suit opening, it
promise a 4-card suit in the other major. A response is requested even
with a blank hand unless the other opponent bids.

\begin{longtable}{p{2.5cm}p{8.5cm}}
  \hline
  \emph{Pass} & Long and solid holding in opponent's suit \\
  \emph{1-level} & 5-8\hcp. \\
  \emph{2-level} & 7-11\hcp. \\
  \emph{3-level} & 9-13\hcp. \\
  \nt{1} & 8-10\hcp\ with stopper in opponent's suit. \\
  \emph{Jump} & 9+\hcp. \\
  \hline
\end{longtable}

If the doubler rebids or raises, it indicates a power hand of 16+\hcp.

\gap

Doubles of an opponent's overcall are \emph{negative} doubles
indicating a lack of a biddable 5-card suit and no fit with partner's
bid suit. Interest in one of the unbid suits is strongly indicated.

At the one-level, the \emph{negative} double shows 8-15\hcp; at the
two-level, it shows 11-15\hcp. Over an opponent's overcall in a major,
it promises a 4-card holding in the other major.

\gap

A double in a competitive auction is a \emph{responsive} double
indicating 3-card support in partner's suit.

\gap

A double of a slam contract is a \emph{Lightner} double requesting an
unusual lead from partner.

\section{Gadgets and Conventions}

\subsection{Stayman Convention}
\label{stayman}
The \emph{Stayman} convention is used to find a 4-4 major suit fit
after a \nt{1} opening by bidding \cl{2}. Opener responds with one of:

\begin{longtable}{p{2.5cm}p{8.5cm}}
  \hline
  \di{2} & No four card major. \\
  \he{2} & 4-card heart suit, may have 4-card spades. \\
  \sp{2} & 4-card spade suit, no 4-card heart suit. \\
  \hline
\end{longtable}

\subsection{Jacoby Transfers}
\label{jacoby}

After a \nt{1} opening, responder bids \di{2} with a 5-card or better
heart suit and \he{2} with spades. Opener will bid \he{2} or \sp{2} so
that the strong hand becomes declarer. Responder's rebids are:

\begin{longtable}{p{2.5cm}p{8.5cm}}
  \hline
  \emph{Pass} & A weak hand with 5+-card \he{} or \sp{}. \\
  \sp{2} & Invitational with 5-5 in the majors after
           \nt{1}--\di{2}--\he{2}. \\
  \nt{2} & Balanced or semi-balanced hand with 5-card \he{} or
           \sp{}. Invitational---partner can pass or sign-off in 3 of major or bid \nt{3}. \\
  \cl{3}, \di{3} & 4-card suit in addition to 5-card major,
                   \underline{game forcing}.. \\
  \emph{Raise} & 6-card suit, invitational. \\
  \he{3} & (After \sp{2}) 5-5 in the majors with slam
           interest. Stronger than an immediate jump to \he{4}. \\
  \sp{3} & (After \he{2}) Singleton or void with slam interest. \\
  \nt{3} & Balanced or semi-balanced hand. Partner can pass or correct
           to 4 of major. \\
  \he{4} & (After \sp{2}) 5-5 in majors with no slam interest. Partner
           can pass or correct to \sp{4}. \\
  \emph{Double raise} & 6+-card major, sign-off. \\
  \nt{4} & Quantitative, inviting slam in major or no-trumps. \\
  \hline
\end{longtable}

\subsection{Jacoby 2NT}
\label{jacoby2nt}

A \nt{2} response over an opening of \he{1} or \sp{1} is conventional
and shows 13+\hcp\ with 4+-card support of partner's suit. It is
\underline{forcing to game}.

Opener's rebids would be:

\begin{longtable}{p{5cm}p{6cm}}
  \hline
  \emph{New suit} & Singleton or void in suit bid. \\
  \emph{Rebid of suit at 3-level} & Maximum strength hand. \\
  \emph{Jump shift} & Good 5+-card side suit. \\
  \emph{Game in original suit} & Minimum opening, sign-off. \\
  \nt{3} & 12-13 \hcp, medium strength hand. \\
  \hline
\end{longtable}


\subsection{Gerber Convention}
\label{gerber}

An immediate response of \cl{4} to any no-trump bid (or overcall) is
\emph{Gerber}. A jump rebid of \cl{4} in response to a natural
no-trump bid is \emph{Gerber} as also when a trump suit has not been
identified and no-trumps has been rebid. Gerber should not be used
holding a void.

Opener shows number of aces in steps as follows:

\begin{longtable}{p{2.5cm}p{8.5cm}}
  \hline
  \di{4} & Zero or Four aces. \\
  \he{4} & One ace. \\
  \sp{4} & Two aces. \\
  \nt{4} & Three aces. \\
  \hline
\end{longtable}

\subsection{RKC Blackwood}
\label{blackwood}

A \emph{Roman Key Card Blackwood} bid of \nt{4} is used to enquire
about the number of key cards (any ace or the trump suit king) in partner's hand.

\emph{Blackwood} should not be used when you have a void or two
fast losers.

The responses to the bid of \nt{4} are in steps and differ depending
on whether opponents have bid over \nt{4}. Note that the 3rd and 4th
steps show only 2 key cards if opponents have intervened since the 5
key card response is shown by step 2 in such cases.

\begin{longtable}{p{3.2cm}|p{1.2cm}p{3.2cm}p{3.2cm}}
  \emph{Holding} & \emph{Silent} & \emph{Double (ROPI)} & \emph{Overcall (DOPI)} \\
  \hline
  \emph{1/4 key cards} & \cl{5} & \emph{Redouble} & \emph{Double} \\
  \emph{0/3 key cards} & \di{5} & \emph{Pass} (0/3/5 key cards) & \emph{Pass} (0/3/5 key cards) \\
  \emph{2/5 key cards
  without queen of trumps} & \he{5} & \cl{5} (two key cards) & \emph{Cheapest suit} (two key cards)
  \\
  \emph{2/5 key cards
  and queen of trumps} & \sp{5} & \di{5} (two key cards) & \emph{Second-cheapest suit} (two key cards)\\
  
  \hline
\end{longtable}

When holding a void, after a trump suit is agreed, jumping to another
suit at the 4 or 5 level in the void suit initiates a \emph{key card
  exclusion} asking bid. Partner shows his key cards \emph{excluding} any
in the void suit in steps.

\begin{longtable}{p{2.5cm}p{8.5cm}}
  \hline
  \emph{1 step} & 1 or 4 key cards. \\
  \emph{2 steps} & 0 or 3 key cards. \\
  \emph{3 steps} & 2 or 5 key cards without trump Q. \\
  \emph{4 steps} & 2 or 5 key cards with trump Q. \\
  \hline
\end{longtable}

\subsection{Bergen Raises}

\hypertarget{bergen}
After a \he{1} or \sp{1} opening, responses of \cl{3}, \di{3}, \he{3}
and \sp{3} show different types of 4-card support. The mnemonic
\emph{CLAP} (Constructive, Limited and Preemptive) helps to remember
the order of the bids.

\begin{longtable}{p{2.5cm}p{8.5cm}}
  \hline
  \emph{\he{1}--\cl{3}} & Constructive, 7-10\hcp, 4-card \he{}. \\
  \emph{\he{1}--\di{3}} & Limited, 10-12\hcp, 4-card \he{}. \\
  \emph{\he{1}--\he{3}} & Preemptive, 0-6\hcp, 4-card \he{}. \\
  \emph{\sp{1}--\cl{3}} & Constructive, 7-10\hcp, 4-card \sp{}. \\
  \emph{\sp{1}--\di{3}} & Limited, 10-12\hcp, 4-card \sp{}. \\
  \emph{\sp{1}--\he{3}} & Strong, 12+\hcp, 4-card \sp{}, undisclosed singleton/void. \\
  \emph{\sp{1}--\sp{3}} & Preemptive, 7-10\hcp, 4-card \sp{}. \\
  \hline
\end{longtable}

\section{Miscellaneous}

\emph{High-card Points} (\hcp) are assigned as follows---Ace: 4, King:
3, Queen: 2 and Jack: 1.  Once a trump-fit has been found,
distribution points can be assigned---Void: 3, Singleton: 2,
Doubleton: 1. Singleton honours should be counted only once (either
\hcp\ or shortness).

\gap

\emph{Suit Quality} (\sq) is calculated as suit length plus number of
honours in the suit. The Jack or Ten should be counted only if a
higher ranking honour is held. For example, a holding of K-J-9-5-4
would have 7\sq\ but J-10-9-5-4 would have 5\sq.

For an overcall, the \sq\ should equal or exceed the number of tricks
bid (e.g., \sq\ of 8 for a 2-level overcall).

When preempting, the \sq\ should equal the level of preempt when
vulnerable and can be one less when non-vulnerable.

\gap

The \emph{Losing Trick Count} (\ltc) is used only once a trump suit
has been established. Count losers only in the top three cards of the
suit holding---there are never more than 3 losers in a suit. With
three or more cards, A/K/Q are not losers but any lower card is a
loser. With two cards, only A or K are not losers.

Add your and partner's loser count and subtract from 24 to estimate
the number of tricks that can be won.  You can estimate your partner's
\ltc\ as follows:

\begin{tabular}{p{2.5cm}p{8.5cm}}
  \emph{\hcp{}} & \emph{Expected Losers} \\
  \hline
  \emph{7-9} & 8-9 losers (9) \\
  \emph{10-12} & 7-8 losers (8) \\
  \emph{13-15} & 6-7 losers (7) \\
  \emph{16-18} & 5-6 losers (6) \\
  \emph{19-21} & 4-5 losers (5) \\
  \emph{22+} & 4 losers or less \\
  \hline
\end{tabular}

\end{document}
